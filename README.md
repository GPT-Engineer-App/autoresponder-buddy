Analytics: Track and display usage statistics, response times, and user engagement metrics.
Integration: Ensure compatibility with major messaging platforms and APIs for seamless integration.
Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance: The system should handle a high volume of messages with minimal latency.
Scalability: Design the architecture to be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users and messages.
Reliability: Ensure a high level of uptime and quick recovery from any failures.
User Experience: The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing for easy navigation and management of autoresponder settings.
Development Stages:

Requirement Analysis: Gather detailed requirements from stakeholders and define the scope of the project.
Design: Create wireframes and design the system architecture.
Implementation: Develop the application using the GPT Engineer App, focusing on the core functionalities first.
Testing: Perform thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a production environment and monitor its performance.
Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates to the application.
